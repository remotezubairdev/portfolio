      These basic skill already gave me a blueprint of coming to the level of earning money online quickly so I chose Front-end Web Development. But with the roadmap to web development I still learned basic API integrations and got knowledge
       about databases, servers. This skill is very valuable (atleast till now), And I would highly 
       recommend anyone to learn using free resources across the internet. `,

      as it tends to make me focus more on my actual work instead of searching for different dependencies 
      and the file-based routing is just amazing. The framework takes the best part of react and compiles them with
       SSR, CSR and uses caching. Thereby, this should be enough to convince you into using Next.js as your new framework with 
       demand in the market aswell. I would highly recommend watching SuperSimpleDev on YouTube.`,
